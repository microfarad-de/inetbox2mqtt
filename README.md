# inetbox2mqtt CPython Port

This is a fork of the original inetbox2mqtt Truma iNet Box emulator found under https://github.com/mc0110/inetbox2mqtt for the purpose of for porting it to standard CPython.

The original inetbox2mqtt has been implemented in MicroPython and is meant to run on a dedicated microcontroller board such as an ESP32. Since some of the RV installations already run the Victron Cerbo GX Venus OS on a standard Raspberry Pi, it would be good to use the same for executing the intebox2mqtt.

The approach consists of porting inetbox2mqtt from MicroPython to the standard CPython for running it on the Raspberry Pi. The Web OS is no longer needed, since the configuration file `etc/inetbox2mqtt` can be directly edited by connecting the RPi via SSH. Whereas the encrypted configuration generated by the Web OS has been replaced by a plain text config file.

Since the Venus OS manages its own network connectivity, all network configuration code has been removed from `connect.py`.

The status LED functionality used for LIN bus debugging has also been disabled, since the user can directly access the log files to achieve the same.
